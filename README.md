# 🌾 AgriData Explorer: Indian Agricultural Insights

## 📘 Project Overview

**AgriData Explorer** is a comprehensive data analytics project designed to provide insights into India’s agricultural production trends using interactive visualizations in Power BI. The project uses a cleaned dataset from ICRISAT and connects to a PostgreSQL database using Python. This helps stakeholders like policy makers, analysts, and researchers track and compare crop performance across different states and districts over the last 50 years.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze agricultural crop production data state-wise and district-wise
- Identify trends in rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseed crops
- Calculate crop yield efficiency and production growth
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with dropdown filters and visuals
- Use PostgreSQL for storing and querying structured agricultural data
